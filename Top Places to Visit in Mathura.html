          <p class="lead">Shree Bankey Bihari Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Krishna, in the holy city of Vrindavan in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh. It is situated near Shri RadhaVallabh Temple.This temple is among the 7 temples of Thakur of Vrindavan including Shri RadhaVallabh Ji, Shri Govind Dev Ji and four others. Bankey Bihari Ji was originally worshipped at Nidhivana. Bankey means “bent in three places” and Bihari means “supreme enjoyer.” The image of Lord Krishna stands in the Tribhanga posture. Haridas Swami originally worshipped this devotional image under the name of Kunj-Bihari (“Enjoyer of Lakes”).

            ‘Bānke’ means ‘bent’, and ‘Bihāri’ or ‘Vihāri’ means ‘enjoyer’. This is how Kṛṣṇa, who is bent in three places, got the name “Bānke Bihāri”.</p>

              <p class="lead">The Krishna Janambhumi, at Mathura,  is important because this is where Lord Shree Krishna manifested Himself in the prison house of the cruel king Kansa and set free his father Vasudeva and his mother Devaki. His purpose was to destroy evil, protect the virtuous, and establish righteousness on a firm footing. Adjacent to the entrance of the prison cell, stands the temple where Astabhuja Maa Yogmaya manifested. The divine ambience of the sanctum sanctorum thrills the hearts of the devotees as soon as they enter the auspicious place, and a sense of conviction surges in their minds that this indeed is the place where Lord Krishna manifested Himself. He gave mankind extraordinary and thought provoking ideas, in the Sacred Scripture, The Bhagavata Gita. The Bhagavat Gita lays the basis of how life should be led in the various walks that govern our life on this earth,  as our soul is immortal!.</p>

The hill is built of sandstone and rises 80 feet tall with a perimeter of 38 kilometres.According to legend, Lord Krishna raised the Govardhan Hill with one finger as a kid to save his hometown, Mathura, from heavy rains and thunderstorms.

Then, they walk 23 kilometres barefoot around the mountain in a 'parikrama to pay their obeisance.'</p>
